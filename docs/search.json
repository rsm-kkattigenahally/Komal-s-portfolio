The previous highest donation (hpa) had a mean of $59.38, with values ranging from $0 to $1000.\nDonor history shows that the average donor made 8 prior donations (freq), with some making over 200.\nState-level response rates averaged 2.06% overall, with slightly higher response among treated individuals (2.20%) compared to control (1.77%).\nDemographic indicators reveal:\n\nAbout 28% of donors were female, and 9% were couples.\nThe average median household income by zip code was around $54,816.\nThe average zip code was 82% white, 9% Black, and 87% urban.\nAbout 39% of zip code residents had a bachelor’s degree or higher.\n\n\n\n\nBalance Test\n\nT-statistic test on multiple variables in treatment and control groups\nAs an ad hoc test of the randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another. t-test is performed on a number of variables among the treatment and control group. the following code is used to perform the t-tests on different variables.\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import t\n\n# Split treatment and control\ntreatment_group = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['amountchange'].dropna()\ncontrol_group = df[df['treatment'] == 0]['amountchange'].dropna()\n\n# Means\nmean_treat = np.mean(treatment_group)\nmean_control = np.mean(control_group)\n\n# Sizes\nn_treat = len(treatment_group)\nn_control = len(control_group)\n\n# Variances\nvar_treat = np.var(treatment_group, ddof=1)\nvar_control = np.var(control_group, ddof=1)\n\n# --- Manual t-statistic ---\nnumerator = mean_treat - mean_control\ndenominator = np.sqrt((var_treat / n_treat) + (var_control / n_control))\nt_stat = numerator / denominator\n\n# --- Degrees of Freedom ---\ndf_num = (var_treat / n_treat + var_control / n_control) ** 2\ndf_den = ((var_treat / n_treat) ** 2) / (n_treat - 1) + ((var_control / n_control) ** 2) / (n_control - 1)\ndf = df_num / df_den\n\n# --- Two-tailed p-value ---\np_value = 2 * t.sf(np.abs(t_stat), df)\n\nprint(f\"T-statistic: {t_stat:.4f}\")\nprint(f\"Degrees of freedom: {df:.2f}\")\nprint(f\"P-value: {p_value:.4f}\")\n\nif p_value &lt; 0.05:\n    print(\"Statistically significant at 95% confidence level\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not statistically significant\")\nThe following variables were tested (along with the t-test statistic):\n\n‘mrm2’ (number of months since last donation) - T-statistic: 0.1195 P-value: 0.9049.

Probit results do not, despite Table 3 indicating its results come from probit regressions…\n\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\nA series of T-tests are performed to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. The following observations were recorded :\n\nTable 3: T-Test Results for Match Ratio Comparisons\n\n\n\nTest Comparison\nt-statistic\np-value\n\n\n\n\n1:1 vs 2:1\n-0.9650\n0.3345\n\n\n1:1 vs 3:1\n-1.0150\n0.3101\n\n\n2:1 vs 3:1\n-0.0501\n0.9600\n\n\n\nAll the above tests have a very large P-value (p &gt; 0.05). This suggests that there is no significant statistical difference in the donation likelihood when different higher match ratios are offered which are in line with the author’s article on page 8.\nA regression test to support the above argument is also conducted with match ratios as the independent variable and ‘gave’ as the dependent variable. The code below is used to regress ‘gave’ on match ratios code\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\ndf = pd.read_csv('file_path')\n\n# Create dummy for ratio1 (1:1 match)\ndf['ratio1'] = np.where(df['ratio'] == \"1\", 1, 0)\n\n# Prepare features and outcome\nX = df[['ratio1', 'ratio2', 'ratio3']]\ny = df['gave'].astype(int)\n\n# Add constant\nX = sm.add_constant(X)\n\n# Fit OLS model\nmodel = sm.OLS(y, X, missing='drop').fit()\n\n# Show summary\nprint(model.summary())\nThe results of the regression are tabulated further. #### Table 4: OLS Regression — Probability of Donation (gave)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nCoefficient\nStd.

Both the T-tests and the Regression results support this argument.\nThe difference in average response rate between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios are calculated from the data collected. The values are shown in Table 5.2 The difference in average response rate between thecoeffecients of match ratios calculated using the regression (as seen in Table 4) estimated earlier turns out to be equal to those seen in Table 5.2 and Table 6.\n# Calculate group-wise response rates from raw data\nrate_1to1 = df[df['ratio1'] == 1]['gave'].mean()\nrate_2to1 = df[df['ratio2'] == 1]['gave'].mean()\nrate_3to1 = df[df['ratio3'] == 1]['gave'].mean()\n\n# Compute differences\ndiff_2_vs_1 = rate_2to1 - rate_1to1\ndiff_3_vs_2 = rate_3to1 - rate_2to1\ndiff_3_vs_1 = rate_3to1 - rate_1to1\n\n\nTable 5.1: Response Rates by Match Ratio (From Data)\n\n\n\nMatch Ratio\nResponse Rate\n\n\n\n\n1:1\n0.0207\n\n\n2:1\n0.0226\n\n\n3:1\n0.0227\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 5.2: Response Rate Differences by Match Ratio (From Data)\n\n\n\nComparison\nResponse Rate Difference\n\n\n\n\n2:1 vs 1:1\n0.0019\n\n\n3:1 vs 2:1\n0.0001\n\n\n3:1 vs 1:1\n0.0020\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 6: Regression Coefficient Differences by Match Ratio\n\n\n\nComparison\nRegression Coefficient Difference\n\n\n\n\n2:1 vs 1:1\n0.0048 - 0.0029 = 0.0019\n\n\n3:1 vs 2:1\n0.0049 - 0.0048 = 0.0001\n\n\n3:1 vs 1:1\n0.0049 - 0.0029 = 0.0020\n\n\n\nBoth the raw data and the regression results show that increasing the match ratio has only a very small effect on the probability of donating. The increase from a 1:1 to a 2:1 match raises the response rate by just 0.19 percentage points, and from 2:1 to 3:1 by only 0.01 percentage points.This indicates that larger match ratios do not provide additional meaningful gains, consistent with the authors’ conclusion.\n\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\nI performed a T-test on the ‘amount’ variable for treatment group.\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom scipy.stats import t\n\n# Prepare data\ntreat_amt = df[df['treatment'] == 1]['amount'].dropna()\ncontrol_amt = df[df['treatment'] == 0]['amount'].dropna()\n\n# Sample sizes\nn1 = len(treat_amt)\nn0 = len(control_amt)\n\n# Means\nmean1 = np.mean(treat_amt)\nmean0 = np.mean(control_amt)\n\n# Variances (sample)\nvar1 = np.var(treat_amt, ddof=1)\nvar0 = np.var(control_amt, ddof=1)\n\n# Compute t-statistic manually\nnumerator = mean1 - mean0\ndenominator = np.sqrt((var1 / n1) + (var0 / n0))\nt_stat_manual = numerator / denominator\n\n# Degrees of freedom \ndf_num = (var1 / n1 + var0 / n0) ** 2\ndf_den = ((var1 / n1) ** 2) / (n1 - 1) + ((var0 / n0) ** 2) / (n0 - 1)\ndof = df_num / df_den\n\n# Compute p-value (two-sided)\np_val_manual = 2 * t.sf(np.abs(t_stat_manual), dof)\nThe t-statistic was 1.9183 and the p-value was 0.0551, which is slightly above the conventional 5% significance level. This indicates that the difference in average donation amount between the treatment and control groups is not statistically significant at the standard threshold. While the result suggests that receiving a matching grant letter might increase donation amounts, the evidence is not strong enough to confirm a significant effect.\nTo analyze the effect of treatment on donation amount conditional on donating, I ran a bivariate OLS regression restricted to individuals with positive donation amounts (amount &gt; 0). The tabulated in Table 7. The intercept indicates that control group donors donated an average of $45.54, while treated donors donated $1.67 less on average. However, this difference is not statistically significant since the p value = 0.561). Since the model conditions on having donated, the treatment effect here does not have a causal interpretation, and reflects only differences among those already inclined to give.\n\nTable 7: OLS Regression — Donation Amount (Only Donors)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nCoefficient\nStd.

The average donation in the control group is slightly higher than in the treatment group. This matches your earlier OLS regression result: The treatment group gave $1.67 less on average (not statistically significant)."

You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. This average will likely be “noisey” when only averaging a few numbers, but should “settle down” and approximate the treatment effect (0.004 = 0.022 - 0.018) as the sample size gets large. Explain the chart to the reader.\nI simulate 10,000 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution and further calculate a vector of 10,000 differences. This simulation in conducted using the code below\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# Simulate 10,000 binary draws\ncontrol = np.random.binomial(n=1, p=0.018, size=10000)\ntreatment = np.random.binomial(n=1, p=0.022, size=10000)\n\n# Compute difference in outcomes\ndifferences = treatment - control\n\n# Compute cumulative average\ncumulative_avg = np.cumsum(differences) / np.arange(1, len(differences) + 1)\n\n# Plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nplt.plot(cumulative_avg, color='purple')\nplt.axhline(0.004, color='red', linestyle='--', label='True Treatment Effect = 0.004')\nplt.title(\"Cumulative Average of Simulated Differences Between Treatment and Control\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Number of Simulations\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Cumulative Average Difference\")\nplt.legend()\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()\n\nFigure 3: Cumulative Average of Simulated Differences Between Treatment and Control\n The chart above demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) using simulated binary outcomes from a Bernoulli distribution. In this simulation:\n\nControl group donations were drawn with probability p = 0.018\nTreatment group donations were drawn with p = 0.022\n\nThe cumulative difference in donation behavior between the groups was tracked across 10,000 simulations. While the average difference fluctuates at first due to randomness, it gradually settles near 0.004, the true treatment effect. This convergence illustrates the Law of Large Numbers: as the sample size increases, the sample average approaches the true population average.\n\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. The repeat for the other 3 histograms. Explain this sequence of histograms and its relationship to the central limit theorem to the reader.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem: Simulation\nThe sequence of histograms below in Figure 4 illustrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). Each plot shows the distribution of the difference in sample means between a treatment group (p = 0.022) and a control group (p = 0.018) based on 1000 simulations for different sample sizes.\nAs the sample size increases: - The distribution of the average differences becomes more symmetric and bell-shaped - The sampling distribution centers around the true treatment effect (0.004) - The variability (spread) decreases\nThis demonstrates the CLT: as sample size increases, the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original (Bernoulli) distribution of the data. The code for simulation is given below.\n\nFigure 4: Central Limit Theorem - Simulation\n\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem - Simulation\n\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Set seed for reproducibility\nnp.random.seed(42)\n\n# Settings\nsample_sizes = [50, 200, 500, 1000]\nsimulations = 1000\ntrue_diff = 0.022 - 0.018\n\n# Create 4 subplots\nfig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(12, 8))\n\nfor idx, n in enumerate(sample_sizes):\n    diffs = []\n\n    for _ in range(simulations):\n        control = np.random.binomial(1, 0.018, size=n)\n        treatment = np.random.binomial(1, 0.022, size=n)\n        diff = np.mean(treatment) - np.mean(control)\n        diffs.append(diff)\n\n    ax = axes[idx // 2][idx % 2]\n    sns.histplot(diffs, bins=30, kde=True, ax=ax, color='lightblue')\n    ax.axvline(true_diff, color='red', linestyle='--', label='True Treatment Effect = 0.004')\n    ax.set_title(f\"Sample Size = {n}\")\n    ax.set_xlabel(\"Difference in Means\")\n    ax.legend()\n\nplt.tight_layout()\nplt.show()"
